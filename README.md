Creates a circular window that displays the video from a webcam.

Uses Qt for creating the window and opening the webcam

Tested under OSX, and uses the Permission system to request access to the
camera.

The Window cannot be moved, it needs a tool to move and resize the window, I 
am using https://getmoves.app

How I created it: I asked ChatGPT for the boilerplate code for it, and then
finished the details manually

Use Case: I use it to show a circle of my talking head in a corner of the
screen, when I record a screen video of me explaining something.

License: The Unlicense

It is a trivial tool that I created in a few days, and it can propably be
recreated by anyone familiar with Qt and C++ in a small amount of time.
